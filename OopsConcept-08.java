//        Simula is considered as the first object-oriented programming language.

//OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System):
    
//Object : Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc.
    
//Class : Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
    
//Inheritance : When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object, known as inheritance. It provides code reusability.
    
//Polymorphism : When one task is performed by different ways, known as polymorphism.
    
//Abstraction : Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
                           //in java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
    
//Encapsulation : Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. 
                               //For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
